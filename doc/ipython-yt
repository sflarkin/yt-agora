# This is an example of a 'profile' file which includes a base file and adds
# some customizaton for a particular purpose.

# If this file is found in the user's ~/.ipython directory as ipythonrc-math,
# it can be loaded by calling passing the '-profile math' (or '-p math')
# option to IPython.

# This example is a light customization to have ipython have basic math functions
# readily available, effectively making the python prompt a very capable scientific
# calculator

# include base config and only add some extras
include ipythonrc

# load the complex math functions but keep them in a separate namespace
