.. _determining-version:

How can I tell what version of yt I'm using?
--------------------------------------------

If you run into problems with yt and you're writing to the mailing list
or contacting developers on IRC, they will likely want to know what version of
yt you're using.  Oftentimes, you'll want to know both the yt version, 
as well as the last changeset that was committed to the branch you're using.  
To reveal this, go to a command line and type:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ yt version

    yt module located at:
        /Users/username/src/yt-x86_64/src/yt-hg
    The supplemental repositories are located at:
        /Users/username/src/yt-x86_64/src/yt-supplemental

    The current version and changeset for the code is:

    ---
    Version = 2.7-dev
    Changeset = 6bffc737a67a
    ---

    This installation CAN be automatically updated.
    yt dependencies were last updated on
    Wed Dec  4 15:47:40 MST 2013

    To update all dependencies, run "yt update --all".

If the changeset is displayed followed by a "+", it means you have made 
modifications to the code since the last changeset.

.. _getting-sample-data:

How can I get some sample data for yt?
--------------------------------------

Many different sample datasets can be found at http://yt-project.org/data/ .
These can be downloaded, unarchived, and they will each create their own
directory.  It is generally straight forward to load these datasets, but if
you have any questions about loading data from a code with which you are 
unfamiliar, please visit :ref:`loading-data`.

To make things easier to load these sample datasets, you can add the parent
directory to your downloaded sample data to your *yt path*.
If you set the option ``test_data_dir``, in the section ``[yt]``,
in ``~/.yt/config``, yt will search this path for them.

This means you can download these datasets to ``/big_drive/data_for_yt`` , add
the appropriate item to ``~/.yt/config``, and no matter which directory you are
in when running yt, it will also check in *that* directory.

.. _faq-scroll-up:

I can't scroll-up to previous commands inside iyt
-------------------------------------------------

If the up-arrow key does not recall the most recent commands, there is
probably an issue with the readline library. To ensure the yt python
environment can use readline, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ~/yt/bin/pip install gnureadline

.. _faq-new-field:

How do I modify whether or not yt takes the log of a particular field?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

yt sets up defaults for many fields for whether or not a field is presented
in log or linear space. To override this behavior, you can modify the
``field_info`` dictionary.  For example, if you prefer that ``density`` not be
logged, you could type:

.. code-block:: python
    
    ds = load("my_data")
    ds.index
    ds.field_info['density'].take_log = False

From that point forward, data products such as slices, projections, etc., would
be presented in linear space. Note that you have to instantiate ds.index before 
you can access ds.field info.

.. _faq-handling-log-vs-linear-space:

I added a new field to my simulation data, can yt see it?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! yt identifies all the fields in the simulation's output file
and will add them to its ``field_list`` even if they aren't listed in
:ref:`field-list`. These can then be accessed in the usual manner. For
example, if you have created a field for the potential called
``PotentialField``, you could type:

.. code-block:: python

   ds = load("my_data")
   ad = ds.all_data()
   potential_field = ad["PotentialField"]

The same applies to fields you might derive inside your yt script
via :ref:`creating-derived-fields`. To check what fields are
available, look at the properties ``field_list`` and ``derived_field_list``:

.. code-block:: python

   print ds.field_list
   print ds.derived_field_list

.. _faq-old-data:

yt seems to be plotting from old data
--------------------------------------

yt does check the time stamp of the simulation so that if you
overwrite your data outputs, the new set will be read in fresh by
yt. However, if you have problems or the yt output seems to be
in someway corrupted, try deleting the ``.yt`` and
``.harray`` files from inside your data directory. If this proves to
be a persistent problem add the line:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.config import ytcfg; ytcfg["yt","serialize"] = "False"

to the very top of your yt script. 

.. _faq-mpi4py:

How can I change yt's log level? 
--------------------------------

yt's default log level is ``INFO``. However, you may want it to shut up, especially
if you are in an IPython notebook or running a long or parallel script. On the other
hand, you may want it to speak up, since you can't figure out exactly what's going 
wrong, and you want to output some debugging information. The yt log level can be 
changed using the :ref:`configuration`, either by setting it in the ``$HOME/.yt/config``
file:

.. code-block:: bash

   [yt]
   loglevel = 10 # This sets the log level to "DEBUG"
   
which would produce debug (as well as info, warning, and error) messages, or at runtime:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.config import ytcfg
   ytcfg["yt","loglevel"] = "40" # This sets the log level to "ERROR"
   
which in this case would suppress everything below error messages. For reference, the numerical 
values corresponding to different log levels are:

+----------+---------------+
| Level    | Numeric Value |
+==========+===============+
| CRITICAL | 50            |
+----------+---------------+
| ERROR	   | 40            |
+----------+---------------+
| WARNING  | 30            |
+----------+---------------+
| INFO	   | 20            |
+----------+---------------+
| DEBUG	   | 10            |
+----------+---------------+
| NOTSET   | 0             |
+----------+---------------+

yt complains that it needs the mpi4py module
--------------------------------------------

For yt to be able to incorporate parallelism on any of its analysis, 
it needs to be able to use MPI libraries.  This requires the ``mpi4py``
module to be installed in your version of python.  Unfortunately, 
installation of ``mpi4py`` is *just* tricky enough to elude the yt
batch installer.  So if you get an error in yt complaining about mpi4py like:

.. code-block:: bash

    ImportError: No module named mpi4py

then you should install ``mpi4py``.  The easiest way to install it is through
the pip interface.  At the command line, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mpi4py

What this does is it finds your default installation of python (presumably
in the yt source directory), and it installs the mpi4py module.  If this
action is successful, you should never have to worry about your aforementioned
problems again.  If, on the other hand, this installation fails (as it does on
such machines as NICS Kraken, NASA Pleaides and more), then you will have to
take matters into your own hands.  Usually when it fails, it is due to pip
being unable to find your MPI C/C++ compilers (look at the error message).
If this is the case, you can specify them explicitly as per:

.. code-block:: bash

    env MPICC=/path/to/MPICC pip install mpi4py

So for example, on Kraken, I switch to the gnu C compilers (because yt 
doesn't work with the portland group C compilers), then I discover that
cc is the mpi-enabled C compiler (and it is in my path), so I run:

.. code-block:: bash

    module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu
    env MPICC=cc pip install mpi4py

And voila!  It installs!  If this *still* fails for you, then you can 
build and install from source and specify the mpi-enabled c and c++ 
compilers in the mpi.cfg file.  See the `mpi4py installation page <http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/install.html>`_ for details.

yt fails saying that it cannot import yt modules
------------------------------------------------

This is likely because you need to rebuild the source.  You can do 
this automatically by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $YT_HG
    python setup.py develop

where ``$YT_HG`` is the path to the yt mercurial repository.

.. _plugin-file:

What is the "Plugin File"?
--------------------------

The plugin file is a means of modifying the available fields, quantities, data
objects and so on without modifying the source code of yt.  The plugin file
will be executed if it is detected.  It must be located in a ``.yt`` folder
in your home directory and be named ``my_plugins.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $HOME/.yt/my_plugins.py

The code in this file can add fields, define functions, define
datatypes, and on and on.  It is executed at the bottom of ``yt.mods``, and so
it is provided with the entire namespace available in the module ``yt.mods``.
For example, if I created a plugin file containing:

.. code-block:: python

   def _myfunc(field, data):
       return np.random.random(data["density"].shape)
   add_field("some_quantity", function=_myfunc, units='')

then all of my data objects would have access to the field "some_quantity".
Note that the units must be specified as a string, see
:ref:`data_selection_and_fields` for more details on units and derived fields.

.. note::

   Since the ``my_plugins.py`` is parsed inside of ``yt.mods``, you must import
   yt using ``yt.mods`` to use the plugins file.  If you import using
   ``import yt``, the plugins file will not be parsed.  You can tell that your
   plugins file is being parsed by watching for a logging message when you
   import yt.  Note that both the ``yt load`` and ``iyt`` command line entry
   points invoke ``from yt.mods import *``, so the ``my_plugins.py`` file
   will be parsed if you enter yt that way.

You can also define other convenience functions in your plugin file.  For
instance, you could define some variables or functions, and even import common
modules:

.. code-block:: python

   import os

   HOMEDIR="/home/username/"
   RUNDIR="/scratch/runs/"

   def load_run(fn):
       if not os.path.exists(RUNDIR + fn):
           return None
       return load(RUNDIR + fn)

In this case, we've written ``load_run`` to look in a specific directory to see
if it can find an output with the given name.  So now we can write scripts that
use this function:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *

   my_run = load_run("hotgasflow/DD0040/DD0040")

And because we have imported from ``yt.mods`` we have access to the
``load_run`` function defined in our plugin file.
