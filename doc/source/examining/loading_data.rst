Loading Data
============

This section contains information on how to load data into ``yt``, as well as
some important caveats about different data formats.

.. _loading-enzo-data:

Enzo Data
---------

Enzo data is fully supported and cared for by Matthew Turk.  To load an Enzo
dataset, you can use the ``load`` command provided by ``yt.mods`` and supply to
it the parameter file name.  This would be the name of the output file, and it
contains no extension.  For instance, if you have the following files:

.. code-block:: none

   DD0010/
   DD0010/data0010
   DD0010/data0010.index
   DD0010/data0010.cpu0000
   DD0010/data0010.cpu0001
   DD0010/data0010.cpu0002
   DD0010/data0010.cpu0003

You would feed the ``load`` command the filename ``DD0010/data0010`` as
mentioned.

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("DD0010/data0010")

.. rubric:: Caveats

* There are no major caveats for Enzo usage
* Units should be correct, if you utilize standard unit-setting routines.  yt
  will notify you if it cannot determine the units, although this
  notification will be passive.
* 2D and 1D data are supported, but the extraneous dimensions are set to be
  of length 1.0 in "code length" which may produce strange results for volume
  quantities.

.. _loading-orion-data:

Boxlib Data
-----------

yt has been tested with Boxlib data generated by Orion, Nyx, Maestro and
Castro.  Currently it is cared for by a combination of Andrew Myers, Chris
Malone, and Matthew Turk.

To load a Boxlib dataset, you can use the ``load`` command provided by
``yt.mods`` and supply to it the directory file name.  **You must also have the
``inputs`` file in the base directory.**  For instance, if you were in a
directory with the following files:

.. code-block:: none

   inputs
   pltgmlcs5600/
   pltgmlcs5600/Header
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_0
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_0/Cell_H
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_1
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_1/Cell_H
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_2
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_2/Cell_H
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_3
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_3/Cell_H
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_4
   pltgmlcs5600/Level_4/Cell_H

You would feed it the filename ``pltgmlcs5600``:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("pltgmlcs5600")

.. _loading-flash-data:

FLASH Data
----------

FLASH HDF5 data is *mostly* supported and cared for by John ZuHone.  To load a
FLASH dataset, you can use the ``load`` command provided by ``yt.mods`` and
supply to it the file name of a plot file or checkpoint file, but particle
files are not currently directly loadable by themselves, due to the fact that
they typically lack grid information. For instance, if you were in a directory
with the following files:

.. code-block:: none

   cosmoSim_coolhdf5_chk_0026

You would feed it the filename ``cosmoSim_coolhdf5_chk_0026``:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("cosmoSim_coolhdf5_chk_0026")

If you have a FLASH particle file that was created at the same time as
a plotfile or checkpoint file (therefore having particle data
consistent with the grid structure of the latter), its data may be loaded with the
``particle_filename`` optional argument:

.. code-block:: python

    from yt.mods import *
    pf = load("radio_halo_1kpc_hdf5_plt_cnt_0100", particle_filename="radio_halo_1kpc_hdf5_part_0100")

.. rubric:: Caveats

* Please be careful that the units are correctly utilized; yt assumes cgs.

.. _loading-ramses-data:

RAMSES Data
-----------

In yt-3.0, RAMSES data is fully supported.  If you are interested in taking a
development or stewardship role, please contact the yt-dev mailing list.  To
load a RAMSES dataset, you can use the ``load`` command provided by ``yt.mods``
and supply to it the ``info*.txt`` filename.  For instance, if you were in a
directory with the following files:

.. code-block:: none

   output_00007
   output_00007/amr_00007.out00001
   output_00007/grav_00007.out00001
   output_00007/hydro_00007.out00001
   output_00007/info_00007.txt
   output_00007/part_00007.out00001

You would feed it the filename ``output_00007/info_00007.txt``:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("output_00007/info_00007.txt")

yt will attempt to guess the fields in the file.  You may also specify a list
of fields by supplying the ``fields`` keyword in your call to ``load``.

.. _loading-gadget-data:

Gadget Data
-----------

yt has support for reading Gadget data in both raw binary and HDF5 formats.  It
is able to access the particles as it would any other particle dataset, and it
can apply smoothing kernels to the data to produce both quantitative analysis
and visualization.

Gadget data in HDF5 format can be loaded with the ``load`` command:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("snapshot_061.hdf5")

However, yt cannot detect raw-binary Gadget data, and so you must specify the
format as being Gadget:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = GadgetDataset("snapshot_061")

.. _particle-bbox:

Units and Bounding Boxes
++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two additional pieces of information that may be needed.  If your
simulation is cosmological, yt can often guess the bounding box and the units
of the simulation.  However, for isolated simulations and for cosmological
simulations with non-standard units, these must be supplied.  For example, if
a length unit of 1.0 corresponds to a kiloparsec, you can supply this in the
constructor.  yt can accept units such as ``Mpc``, ``kpc``, ``cm``, ``Mpccm/h``
and so on.  In particular, note that ``Mpc/h`` and ``Mpccm/h`` (``cm`` for
comoving here) are usable unit definitions.

yt will attempt to use units for ``mass``, ``length`` and ``time`` as supplied
in the argument ``unit_base``.  The ``bounding_box`` argument is a list of
two-item tuples or lists that describe the left and right extents of the
particles.

.. code-block:: python

   pf = GadgetDataset("snap_004",
           unit_base = {'length': ('kpc', 1.0)},
           bounding_box = [[-600.0, 600.0], [-600.0, 600.0], [-600.0, 600.0]])

.. _particle-indexing-criteria:

Indexing Criteria
+++++++++++++++++

yt generates a global mesh index via octree that governs the resolution of
volume elements.  This is governed by two parameters, ``n_ref`` and
``over_refine_factor``.  They are weak proxies for each other.  The first,
``n_ref``, governs how many particles in an oct results in that oct being
refined into eight child octs.  Lower values mean higher resolution; the
default is 64.  The secon parameter, ``over_refine_factor``, governs how many
cells are in a given oct; the default value of 1 corresponds to 8 cells.
The number of cells in an oct is defined by the expression
``2**(3*over_refine_factor)``.

It's recommended that if you want higher-resolution, try reducing the value of
``n_ref`` to 32 or 16.

.. _gadget-field-spec:

Field Specifications
++++++++++++++++++++

Binary Gadget outputs often have additional fields or particle types that are
non-standard from the default Gadget distribution format.  These can be
specified in the call to ``GadgetDataset`` by either supplying one of the
sets of field specifications as a string or by supplying a field specification
itself.  As an example, yt has built-in definitions for ``default`` (the
default) and ``agora_unlv``.  Field specifications must be tuples, and must be
of this format:

.. code-block:: python

   default = ( "Coordinates",
               "Velocities",
               "ParticleIDs",
               "Mass",
               ("InternalEnergy", "Gas"),
               ("Density", "Gas"),
               ("SmoothingLength", "Gas"),
   )

This is the default specification used by the Gadget frontend.  It means that
the fields are, in order, Coordinates, Velocities, ParticleIDs, Mass, and the
fields InternalEnergy, Density and SmoothingLength *only* for Gas particles.
So for example, if you have defined a Metallicity field for the particle type
Halo, which comes right after ParticleIDs in the file, you could define it like
this:

.. code-block:: python

   my_field_def = ( "Coordinates",
               "Velocities",
               "ParticleIDs",
               ("Metallicity", "Halo"),
               "Mass",
               ("InternalEnergy", "Gas"),
               ("Density", "Gas"),
               ("SmoothingLength", "Gas"),
   )

To save time, you can utilize the plugins file for yt and use it to add items
to the dictionary where these definitions are stored.  You could do this like
so:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.frontends.sph.definitions import gadget_field_specs
   gadget_field_specs["my_field_def"] = my_field_def

Please also feel free to issue a pull request with any new field
specifications, as we're happy to include them in the main distribution!

.. _gadget-ptype-spec:

Particle Type Definitions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In some cases, research groups add new particle types or re-order them.  You
can supply alternate particle types by using the keyword ``ptype_spec`` to the
``GadgetDataset`` call.  The default for Gadget binary data is:

.. code-block:: python

    ( "Gas", "Halo", "Disk", "Bulge", "Stars", "Bndry" )

You can specify alternate names, but note that this may cause problems with the
field specification if none of the names match old names.

.. _gadget-header-spec:

Header Specification
++++++++++++++++++++

If you have modified the header in your Gadget binary file, you can specify an
alternate header specification with the keyword ``header_spec``.  This can
either be a list of strings corresponding to individual header types known to
yt, or it can be a combination of strings and header specifications.  The
default header specification (found in ``yt/frontends/sph/definitions.py``) is:

.. code-block:: python
   
    default      = (('Npart', 6, 'i'),
                    ('Massarr', 6, 'd'),
                    ('Time', 1, 'd'),
                    ('Redshift', 1, 'd'),
                    ('FlagSfr', 1, 'i'),
                    ('FlagFeedback', 1, 'i'),
                    ('Nall', 6, 'i'),
                    ('FlagCooling', 1, 'i'),
                    ('NumFiles', 1, 'i'),
                    ('BoxSize', 1, 'd'),
                    ('Omega0', 1, 'd'),
                    ('OmegaLambda', 1, 'd'),
                    ('HubbleParam', 1, 'd'),
                    ('FlagAge', 1, 'i'),
                    ('FlagMEtals', 1, 'i'),
                    ('NallHW', 6, 'i'),
                    ('unused', 16, 'i'))

These items will all be accessible inside the object ``pf.parameters``, which
is a dictionary.  You can add combinations of new items, specified in the same
way, or alternately other types of headers.  The other string keys defined are
``pad32``, ``pad64``, ``pad128``, and ``pad256`` each of which corresponds to
an empty padding in bytes.  For example, if you have an additional 256 bytes of
padding at the end, you can specify this with:

.. code-block:: python

   header_spec = ["default", "pad256"]

This can then be supplied to the constructor.  Note that you can also do this
manually, for instance with:


.. code-block:: python

   header_spec = ["default", (('some_value', 8, 'd'),
                              ('another_value', 1, 'i'))]

The letters correspond to data types from the Python struct module.  Please
feel free to submit alternate header types to the main yt repository.

.. _specifying-gadget-units:

Specifying Units
++++++++++++++++

If you are running a cosmology simulation, yt will be able to guess the units
with some reliability.  However, if you are not and you do not specify a
parameter file, yt will not be able to and will use the defaults of length
being 1.0 Mpc/h (comoving), velocity being in cm/s, and mass being in 10^10
Msun/h.  You can specify alternate units by supplying the ``unit_base`` keyword
argument of this form:

.. code-block:: python

   unit_base = {'length': (1.0, 'cm'), 'mass': (1.0, 'g'), 'time': (1.0, 's')}

yt will utilize length, mass and time to set up all other units.

.. _loading-tipsy-data:

Tipsy Data
----------

yt also supports loading Tipsy data.  Many of its characteristics are similar
to how Gadget data is loaded; specifically, it shares its definition of
indexing and mesh-identification with that described in
:ref:`particle-indexing-criteria`.  

.. code-block:: python

    ds = load("./halo1e11_run1.00400")

.. _specifying-cosmology-tipsy:

Specifying Tipsy Cosmological Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cosmological parameters can be specified to Tipsy to enable computation of
default units.  The parameters recognized are of this form:

.. code-block:: python

   cosmology_parameters = {'current_redshift': 0.0,
                           'omega_lambda': 0.728,
                           'omega_matter': 0.272,
                           'hubble_constant': 0.702}

These will be used set the units, if they are specified.

.. _loading-artio-data:

ARTIO Data
----------

ARTIO data has a well-specified internal parameter system and has few free
parameters.  However, for optimization purposes, the parameter that provides
the most guidance to yt as to how to manage ARTIO data is ``max_range``.  This
governs the maximum number of space-filling curve cells that will be used in a
single "chunk" of data read from disk.  For small datasets, setting this number
very large will enable more data to be loaded into memory at any given time;
for very large datasets, this parameter can be left alone safely.  By default
it is set to 1024; it can in principle be set as high as the total number of
SFC cells.

To load ARTIO data, you can specify a command such as this:

.. code-block:: python

    ds = load("./A11QR1/s11Qzm1h2_a1.0000.art")

.. _loading-art-data:

ART Data
--------

ART data enjoys preliminary support and has been supported in the past by
Christopher Moody.  Please contact the ``yt-dev`` mailing list if you are
interested in using yt for ART data, or if you are interested in assisting with
development of yt to work with ART data.

To load an ART dataset you can use the ``load`` command provided by 
``yt.mods`` and passing the gas mesh file. It will search for and attempt 
to find the complementary dark matter and stellar particle header and data 
files. However, your simulations may not follow the same naming convention.

So for example, a single snapshot might have a series of files looking like
this:

.. code-block:: none

   10MpcBox_csf512_a0.300.d    #Gas mesh
   PMcrda0.300.DAT             #Particle header
   PMcrs0a0.300.DAT            #Particle data (positions,velocities)
   stars_a0.300.dat            #Stellar data (metallicities, ages, etc.)

The ART frontend tries to find the associated files matching the above, but
if that fails you can specify ``file_particle_data``,``file_particle_data``,
``file_star_data`` in addition to the specifying the gas mesh. You also have 
the option of gridding particles, and assigning them onto the meshes.
This process is in beta, and for the time being it's probably  best to leave
``do_grid_particles=False`` as the default.

To speed up the loading of an ART file, you have a few options. You can turn 
off the particles entirely by setting ``discover_particles=False``. You can
also only grid octs up to a certain level, ``limit_level=5``, which is useful
when debugging by artificially creating a 'smaller' dataset to work with.

Finally, when stellar ages are computed we 'spread' the ages evenly within a
smoothing window. By default this is turned on and set to 10Myr. To turn this 
off you can set ``spread=False``, and you can tweak the age smoothing window
by specifying the window in seconds, ``spread=1.0e7*265*24*3600``. 

.. code-block:: python
    
   from yt.mods import *

   pf = load("/u/cmoody3/data/art_snapshots/SFG1/10MpcBox_csf512_a0.460.d")

.. _loading_athena_data:

Athena Data
-----------

Athena 4.x VTK data is *mostly* supported and cared for by John
ZuHone. Both uniform grid and SMR datasets are supported.

Loading Athena datasets is slightly different depending on whether
your dataset came from a serial or a parallel run. If the data came
from a serial run or you have joined the VTK files together using the
Athena tool ``join_vtk``, you can load the data like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("kh.0010.vtk")

The filename corresponds to the file on SMR level 0, whereas if there
are multiple levels the corresponding files will be picked up
automatically, assuming they are laid out in ``lev*`` subdirectories
under the directory where the base file is located.

For parallel datasets, yt assumes that they are laid out in
directories named ``id*``, one for each processor number, each with
``lev*`` subdirectories for additional refinement levels. To load this
data, call ``load`` with the base file in the ``id0`` directory:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("id0/kh.0010.vtk")

which will pick up all of the files in the different ``id*`` directories for
the entire dataset.

yt works in cgs ("Gaussian") units by default, but Athena data is not
normally stored in these units. If you would like to convert data to
cgs units, you may supply conversions for length, time, and mass to ``load``:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.mods import *
   pf = load("id0/cluster_merger.0250.vtk",
             parameters={"length_unit":(1.0,"Mpc"),
                         "time_unit"(1.0,"Myr"),
                         "mass_unit":(1.0e14,"Msun")})

This means that the yt fields, e.g. ``("gas","density")``, ``("gas","x-velocity")``,
``("gas","magnetic_field_x")``, will be in cgs units, but the Athena fields, e.g.,
``("athena","density")``, ``("athena","velocity_x")``, ``("athena","cell_centered_B_x")``, will be
in code units.

.. rubric:: Caveats

* yt primarily works with primitive variables. If the Athena
  dataset contains conservative variables, the yt primitive fields will be generated from the
  conserved variables on disk.
* Domains may be visualized assuming periodicity.
* Particle list data is currently unsupported.

.. _loading-fits-data:

FITS Data
---------

FITS data is *mostly* supported and cared for by John ZuHone. In order to
read FITS data, `AstroPy <http://www.astropy.org>`_ must be installed. FITS
data cubes can be loaded in the same way by yt as other datasets. yt
can read FITS image files that have the following (case-insensitive) suffixes:

* fits
* fts
* fits.gz
* fts.gz

yt can read two kinds of FITS files: FITS image files and FITS binary table files containing
positions, times, and energies of X-ray events.

.. note::

  AstroPy is necessary due to the requirements of both FITS file reading and
  WCS coordinates. Since new releases of `PyFITS <http://www.stsci
  .edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits>`_ are to be discontinued, individual
  installations of this package and the `PyWCS <http://stsdas.stsci
  .edu/astrolib/pywcs/>`_ package are not supported.

Though FITS a image is composed of one data cube in the FITS file,
upon being loaded into yt it is automatically decomposed into grids:

.. code-block:: python

  from yt.mods import *
  ds = load("m33_hi.fits")
  ds.print_stats()

.. parsed-literal::

  level	  # grids	    # cells	   # cells^3
  ----------------------------------------------
    0	     512	  981940800	         994
  ----------------------------------------------
             512	  981940800

yt will generate its own domain decomposition, but the number of grids can be
set manually by passing the ``nprocs`` parameter to the ``load`` call:

.. code-block:: python

  ds = load("m33_hi.fits", nprocs=1024)

Making the Most of `yt` for FITS Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

yt will load data without WCS information and/or some missing header keywords, but the resulting
field information will necessarily be incomplete. For example, field names may not be descriptive,
and units will not be correct. To get the full use out of yt for FITS files, make sure that for
each image the following header keywords have sensible values:

* ``CDELTx``: The pixel width in along axis ``x``
* ``CRVALx``: The coordinate value at the reference position along axis ``x``
* ``CRPIXx``: The the reference pixel along axis ``x``
* ``CTYPEx``: The projection type of axis ``x``
* ``CUNITx``: The units of the coordinate along axis ``x``
* ``BTYPE``: The type of the image
* ``BUNIT``: The units of the image

FITS header keywords can easily be updated using AstroPy. For example,
to set the ``BTYPE`` and ``BUNIT`` keywords:

.. code-block:: python

    import astropy.io.fits as pyfits
    f = pyfits.open("xray_flux_image.fits", mode="update")
    f[0].header["BUNIT"] = "cts/s/pixel"
    f[0].header["BTYPE"] = "flux"
    f.flush()
    f.close()

FITS Coordinates
++++++++++++++++

For FITS datasets, the unit of ``code_length`` is always the width of one
pixel. yt will attempt to use the WCS information in the FITS header to
construct information about the coordinate system, and provides support for
the following dataset types:

1. Rectilinear 2D/3D images with length units (e.g., Mpc, AU,
   etc.) defined in the ``CUNITx`` keywords
2. 2D images in some celestial coordinate systems (RA/Dec,
   galactic latitude/longitude, defined in the ``CTYPEx``
   keywords), and X-ray binary table event files
3. 3D images with celestial coordinates and a third axis for another
   quantity, such as velocity, frequency, wavelength, etc.
4. 4D images with the first three axes like Case 3, where the slices
   along the 4th axis are interpreted as different fields.

If your data is of the first case, yt will determine the length units based
on the information in the header. If your data is of the second or third
cases, no length units will be assigned, but the world coordinate information
about the axes will be stored in separate fields. If your data is of the fourth
type, the coordinates of the first three axes will be determined according to
cases 1-3.

.. note::

  Linear length-based coordinates (Case 1 above) are only supported if all dimensions
  have the same value for ``CUNITx``. WCS coordinates are only supported for Cases 2-4.

Fields in FITS Datasets
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Multiple fields can be included in a FITS dataset in several different ways.
The first way, and the simplest, is if more than one image HDU is
contained within the same file. The field names will be determined by the
value of ``BTYPE`` in the header, and the field units will be determined by
the value of ``BUNIT``. The second way is if a dataset has a fourth axis,
with each slice along this axis corresponding to a different field. In this
case, the field names will be determined by the value of the ``CTYPE4`` keyword
and the index of the slice. So, for example, if ``BTYPE`` = ``"intensity"`` and
``CTYPE4`` = ``"stokes"``, then the fields will be named
``"intensity_stokes_1"``, ``"intensity_stokes_2"``, and so on.

The third way is if auxiliary files are included along with the main file, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    ds = load("flux.fits", auxiliary_files=["temp.fits","metal.fits"])

The image blocks in each of these files will be loaded as a separate field,
provided they have the same dimensions as the image blocks in the main file.

Additionally, fields corresponding to the WCS coordinates will be generated.
based on the corresponding ``CTYPEx`` keywords. When queried, these fields
will be generated from the pixel coordinates in the file using the WCS
transformations provided by AstroPy.

X-ray event data will be loaded as particle fields in yt, but a grid will be constructed from the
WCS information in the FITS header. There is a helper function, ``setup_counts_fields``,
which may be used to make deposited image fields from the event data for different energy bands
(for an example see :ref:`xray_fits`).

.. note::

  Each FITS image from a single dataset, whether from one file or from one of
  multiple files, must have the same dimensions and WCS information as the
  first image in the primary file. If this is not the case,
  yt will raise a warning and will not load this field.

Additional Options
++++++++++++++++++

FITS image data may include ``NaNs``. If you wish to mask this data out,
you may supply a ``nan_mask`` parameter to ``load``, which may either be a
single floating-point number (applies to all fields) or a Python dictionary
containing different mask values for different fields:

.. code-block::

  # passing a single float
  ds = load("m33_hi.fits", nan_mask=0.0)

  # passing a dict

Generally, AstroPy may generate a lot of warnings about individual FITS
files, many of which you may want to ignore. If you want to see these
warnings, set ``suppress_astropy_warnings = False`` in the call to ``load``.

Examples of Using FITS Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following IPython notebooks show examples of working with FITS data in yt:

* :ref:`radio_cubes`
* :ref:`xray_fits`

Generic Array Data
------------------

Even if your data is not strictly related to fields commonly used in
astrophysical codes or your code is not supported yet, you can still feed it to
``yt`` to use its advanced visualization and analysis facilities. The only
requirement is that your data can be represented as one or more uniform, three
dimensional numpy arrays. Assuming that you have your data in ``arr``,
the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.frontends.stream.api import load_uniform_grid

   data = dict(Density = arr)
   bbox = np.array([[-1.5, 1.5], [-1.5, 1.5], [1.5, 1.5]])
   pf = load_uniform_grid(data, arr.shape, 3.08e24, bbox=bbox, nprocs=12)

will create ``yt``-native parameter file ``pf`` that will treat your array as
density field in cubic domain of 3 Mpc edge size (3 * 3.08e24 cm) and
simultaneously divide the domain into 12 chunks, so that you can take advantage
of the underlying parallelism. 

Particle fields are detected as one-dimensional fields. The number of
particles is set by the ``number_of_particles`` key in
``data``. Particle fields are then added as one-dimensional arrays in
a similar manner as the three-dimensional grid fields:

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.frontends.stream.api import load_uniform_grid

   data = dict(Density = dens, 
               number_of_particles = 1000000,
               particle_position_x = posx_arr, 
	       particle_position_y = posy_arr,
	       particle_position_z = posz_arr)
   bbox = np.array([[-1.5, 1.5], [-1.5, 1.5], [1.5, 1.5]])
   pf = load_uniform_grid(data, arr.shape, 3.08e24, bbox=bbox, nprocs=12)

where in this exampe the particle position fields have been assigned. ``number_of_particles`` must be the same size as the particle
arrays. If no particle arrays are supplied then ``number_of_particles`` is assumed to be zero. 

.. rubric:: Caveats

* Units will be incorrect unless the data has already been converted to cgs.
* Particles may be difficult to integrate.
* Data must already reside in memory.

.. _loading-amr-data:

Generic AMR Data
----------------

It is possible to create native ``yt`` parameter file from Python's dictionary
that describes set of rectangular patches of data of possibly varying
resolution. 

.. code-block:: python

   from yt.frontends.stream.api import load_amr_grids

   grid_data = [
       dict(left_edge = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            right_edge = [1.0, 1.0, 1.],
            level = 0,
            dimensions = [32, 32, 32],
            number_of_particles = 0)
       dict(left_edge = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25],
            right_edge = [0.75, 0.75, 0.75],
            level = 1,
            dimensions = [32, 32, 32],
            number_of_particles = 0)
   ]
  
   for g in grid_data:
       g["density"] = np.random.random(g["dimensions"]) * 2**g["level"]
  
   pf = load_amr_grids(grid_data, [32, 32, 32], 1.0)

Particle fields are supported by adding 1-dimensional arrays and
setting the ``number_of_particles`` key to each ``grid``'s dict:

.. code-block:: python

    for g in grid_data:
        g["number_of_particles"] = 100000
        g["particle_position_x"] = np.random.random((g["number_of_particles"]))

.. rubric:: Caveats

* Units will be incorrect unless the data has already been converted to cgs.
* Some functions may behave oddly, and parallelism will be disappointing or
  non-existent in most cases.
* No consistency checks are performed on the index
* Data must already reside in memory.
* Consistency between particle positions and grids is not checked;
  ``load_amr_grids`` assumes that particle positions associated with one grid are
  not bounded within another grid at a higher level, so this must be
  ensured by the user prior to loading the grid data.
