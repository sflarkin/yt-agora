The Cookbook
============

yt provides a great deal of functionality to the user, but sometimes it can 
be a bit complex.  This section of the documentation lays out examples recipes 
for how to do a variety of tasks.  Most of the early, simple code 
demonstrations are small scripts which you can easily copy and paste into
your own code; however, as we move to more complex tasks, the recipes move to 
iPython notebooks to display intermediate steps.  All of these recipes are
available for download in a link next to the recipe.

Getting the Sample Data
-----------------------

All of the data used in the cookbook is freely available 
`here <http://yt-project.org/data/>`_, where you will find links to download 
individual datasets.

If you want to take a look at more complex recipes, or submit your own,
check out the `yt Hub <http://hub.yt-project.org>`_.

.. note:: To contribute your own recipes, please
