Title: Halo Mass Info
Description: This recipe finds halos and then prints out information about
             them.  Note that this recipe will take advantage of multiple CPUs
             if executed with mpirun and supplied the --parallel command line
             argument.  
Outputs: [RedshiftOutput0006_halo_info.txt]
