      "This example shows how to embed an animation produced by `matplotlib` into an IPython notebook.  This example makes use of `matplotlib`'s [animation toolkit](http://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html) to transform individual frames into a final rendered movie.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, this uses Jake VanderPlas' [`JSAnimation`](https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation) library to embed the movie as a javascript widget, directly in the notebook.  This does not use `ffmpeg` to stitch the frames together and thus does not require `ffmpeg`.  However, you must have `JSAnimation` installed.\n",
