Colormaps
=========

There are several colormaps available for yt.  yt includes all of the 
matplotlib colormaps as well for nearly all functions.  Individual visualization
functions usually allow you to specify a colormap with the ``cmap`` flag.

If you have installed `brewer2mpl`
(`pip install brewer2mpl` or see `https://github.com/jiffyclub/brewer2mpl`_),
you can also access the discrete colormaps available on
`http://colorbrewer2.org`_. Instead of supplying the colormap name, specify
a tuple of the form (name, type, number), for example `('RdBu', 'Diverging', 9)`.
These discrete colormaps will not be interpolated, and can be useful for
creating colorblind/printer/grayscale-friendly plots. For more information,
visit `http://colorbrewer2.org`_.

Here is a chart of all of the yt and matplotlib colormaps available.  In addition to each 
colormap displayed here, you can access its "reverse" by simply appending a 
``"_r"`` to the end of the colormap name.

Displaying Colormaps Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To display the most up to date colormaps locally, you can run:

.. code-block:: python

    import yt
    yt.show_colormaps()

or to output just the colormaps native to yt to an image file, try:

.. code-block:: python

    import yt
    yt.show_colormaps(subset = "yt_native", filename = "yt_native.png")

Applying a Colormap to your Rendering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the visualization functions in yt have a keyword allowing you to
manually specify a specific colormap.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    yt.write_image(im, "output.png", cmap_name = 'jet')

If you're using the Plot Window interface (e.g. SlicePlot, ProjectionPlot, 
etc.), it's even easier than that.  Simply create your rendering, and you
can quickly swap the colormap on the fly after the fact with the ``set_cmap``
callback:

.. code-block:: python

    ds = yt.load("IsolatedGalaxy/galaxy0030/galaxy0030")
    p = yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, "z", "density")

    p.set_cmap(field="density", cmap='jet')
    p.save('proj_with_jet_cmap.png')

    p.set_cmap(field="density", cmap='hot')
    p.save('proj_with_hot_cmap.png')

For more information about the callbacks available to Plot Window objects, 
see :ref:`callbacks`.

Examples of Each Colormap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To give the reader a better feel for how a colormap appears once it is applied
to a dataset, below we provide a library of identical projections of an 
isolated galaxy where only the colormap has changed.  They use the sample 
dataset "IsolatedGalaxy" available at 
`http://yt-project.org/data <http://yt-project.org/data>`_.
