Why Python?
-----------

Well, the easiest answer is that I knew it, and it met the requirements.  The
more interesting answer, though, is a combination of things.  Python right now
has a lot of momentum behind it, particularly in the scientific community.
It's easy to compile, portable across many architectures, relatively simple to
write C-based exntesions for, and it's well-suited to rapid application
development.  With access to an interpreter, new avenues of data-exploration
are opened, and this can lead to much more rapid and interesting analysis.

Where can I learn more about Python?
------------------------------------

There are several good, free books about Python available on the web.  The best
place to start is with the `official tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tut/>`_,
but there's also `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.org/>`_, an
entire `collection of videos <http://showmedo.com/videos/python?topic=beginner_programming>`_ on 
`ShowMeDo.com <http://showmedo.com/>`_, and a much more specific guide to using
`NumPy <http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial>`_, which is the backend
on which all the math done in yt is based.

As far as books go, the only book I've found to be absolutely indispensible is
the `Beazley Book <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710910>`_.

What's up with the names?
-------------------------

In the book `Snow Crash <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash>`_, yt is
Uncle Enzo's messenger.  Lagos is the keeper of the data, Raven is a master
slicer, and so on.

Are there any restrictions on my use of yt?
-------------------------------------------

yt has been released under Version 3 of the 
`GNU General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_.

If you found it useful, and have extended it in some meaningful way, of course
I'd love to see your contributions so they can be shared with the community.
Additionally, if you use yt in a paper, I'd love it if you'd drop me a line to
let me know.

How can I help?
---------------

If you find a bug, report it.  If you do something cool, write it up.  If you
find a place to improve the code, send in a patch. 

Something has gone wrong.  What do I do?
----------------------------------------

Well, first off, double check that you're giving the code what it needs, and
not asking it for something it can't provide.  Use the ``help()`` command on
an object or a method to get more information.

If you can't figure out what's up, please go ahead and copy the resultant
traceback information (the error message it prints out) along with any log
files, and either send an email to the ``yt-users`` mailing list (subscribe
first!) or attach them to a ticket at `<http://yt.spacepope.org/>`_.  

Where can I go for support?
---------------------------

I've set up a ``yt-users`` mailing list.  There's more information about it
at the `yt homepage <http://yt.spacepope.org>`_.
