This directory contains the compiled yt documentation.  Development of the
documentation happens in a mercurial repository, yt-doc, available at:

http://hg.enzotools.org/yt-doc/

It's written to be used with Sphinx, a tool designed for writing Python
documentation.  Sphinx is available at this URL:

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

All of the pre-built HTML files, accessible with any web browser, are available
in the build/ directory, as well as at:

http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/index.html

You can also download a copy of the documentation and unzip it right here:

wget http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/docs_html.zip
unzip docs_html.zip

Then open index.html with your favorite web browser, and be off!
