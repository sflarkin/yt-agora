This directory contains the yt documentation, in ReSTructured Text format.
It's written to be used with Sphinx, a tool designed for writing Python
documentation.  Sphinx is available at this URL:

http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

All of the pre-built HTML files, accessible with any web browser, are available
in the build/ directory, as well as at:

http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/index.html

Additionally, we include pre-generated docs right here for you, inside the zip
file docs_html.zip.  Just do this, and you get the docs, right here!

unzip docs_html.zip

Then open index.html with your favorite web browser, and be off!
