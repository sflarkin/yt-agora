Hi there!  This directory used to contain examples.  Now they're all in the
cookbook!  You can find that by either going to:

http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/

Or by unzipping doc/docs_html.zip and opening the index.html file in a web
browser, and browing to the cookbook.

If you'd like to add a recipe, drop us an email at the yt-users mailing list --
we'd love your contribution!
