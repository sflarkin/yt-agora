This is a light cone generator for yt.  The inputs for creating a light cone 
object are an original Enzo parameter file and a light cone parameter file.  
See sample_lightcone.par in yt/examples for an example.  The light cone 
generator will use all time and redshift data to create a solution that 
patches data outputs together from InitialRedshift to FinalRedshift using 
either as little or as many data outputs as possible.  When the solution is 
calculated, light cone projections can be made of any field and weight field, 
just like ordinary projections.  The final output is an image of the light 
cone projection and an hdf5 file containing the unflattened projection stack.
