        Array, of shape (N,N), to be written into the green channel of the
        output image.  If not already uint8, will be converted (and scaled)

    alpha_channel : array_like or tuple of image info, optional

    This accepts a three- or four-channel `bitmap_array`.  If the image is not
    already uint8, it will be scaled and converted.  If it is not four channel, a
    fourth alpha channel will be added and set to fully opaque.  The resultant
    image will be directly written to `filename` as a PNG with no colormap
    applied.  `max_val` is a value used if the array is passed in as anything
    other than uint8; it will be the value used for scaling and clipping when the
    array is converted.  Additionally, the minimum is assumed to be zero; this
    makes it primarily suited for the results of volume rendered images, rather
    than misaligned projections.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bitmap_array : array_like
        Array of shape (N,M,3) or (N,M,4), to be written.  If it is not already

    max_val : float, optional
        The upper limit to clip values to in the output, if converting to uint8.

    image buffers generated using `yt.raven.FixedResolutionBuffers` and the like.

    Parameters
    ----------

        save in a PNG file.
    filename : string

    color_bounds : tuple of floats, optional
        The min and max to scale between.  Outlying values will be clipped.
    cmap_name : string, optional
        An acceptable colormap.  See either raven.color_maps or
