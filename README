Hi there!  You've just downloaded yt, an analysis tool for astrophysical
simulation datasets, generated by simulation platforms like Enzo, Orion, FLASH,
Nyx, MAESTRO, ART and Ramses.  It's written in python and heavily leverages
both NumPy and Matplotlib for fast arrays and visualization, respectively.

Full documentation and a user community can be found at:

http://yt-project.org/
http://yt-project.org/doc/

If you have used Python before, and are comfortable with installing packages,
you should find the setup.py script fairly straightforward: simply execute
"python setup.py install".

If you would rather a more automated installation, you can use the script
doc/install_script.sh .  You will have to set the destination directory, and
there are options available, but it should be straightforward.

In case of any problems, please email the yt-users mailing list, and if you're
interested in helping out, see the developer documentation:

http://yt-project.org/doc/advanced/developing.html

Enjoy!
