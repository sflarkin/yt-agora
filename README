Hi there.  This is the README file for yt, which is a set of Enzo management
tools.

    yt          -- This base module is always imported, and includes the
                   global configuration for the yt modules.  Additionally,
                   it deals with access to the dependencies that underlie
                   all of the packages, and the logging module.
    enki        -- Here we initiate new runs; enki creates parameter files,
                   manages initial conditions, and handles enzo source code.
    fido        -- Data movement and automated plotting taes place here.  All
                   file handling takes place through fido.  It remains mostly
                   independent of the other modules, so as to be as lightweight
                   as possible.
    lagos       -- This is the heart of our Enzo handling.  All Enzo data
                   structures are kept and defined here.  All data handling
                   takes place through lagos.
    raven       -- This is the plotter, which currently has interfaces to
                   HippoDraw and Matplotlib.  The MPL interface is less mature,
                   but in more active development, and is able to be embedded
                   within the SAGE (www.sagemath.org) project.
    deliverator -- These classes and routines deal with interaction with The
                   Deliverator.  (Eventually the deliverator ittself will be
                   checked into SVN, although in a different repository.)

Please feel free to help out.  The Trac site at http://yt.spacepope.org/ has
mechanisms for ticket submission, as well as an ever-growing Wiki.
