Hi there!  You've just downloaded yt, an analysis tool for 3D Enzo adaptive
mesh refinement datasets.  It's written in python and based on the NumPy and
Matplotlib components.

Full documentation is available at doc/build/html/index.html , as well as
online at http://yt.spacepope.org/ .  For a quick start, assuming you have both
matplotlib and numpy installed, just set your HDF5 install location:

 $ echo /path/to/your/hdf5/root > hdf5.cfg

and then install:

 $ python setup.py install

You might have to use a --prefix= command, however.

Please feel free to help out, and if you make any cool changes or enhancements,
let me know!  The Trac site at http://yt.spacepope.org/ has mechanisms for
ticket and problem submission, as well as an ever-growing Wiki.
