Hi there!  You've just downloaded yt, an analysis tool for scientific
datasets, generated on a variety of data platforms.  It's written in 
python and heavily leverages both NumPy and Matplotlib for fast arrays and 
visualization, respectively.

Full documentation and a user community can be found at:

http://yt-project.org/

http://yt-project.org/doc/

If you have used Python before, and are comfortable with installing packages,
you should find the setup.py script fairly straightforward: simply execute
"python setup.py install".

If you would rather a more automated installation, you can use the script
doc/install_script.sh .  You will have to set the destination directory, and
there are options available, but it should be straightforward.

For more information on installation, what to do if you run into problems, or 
ways to help development, please visit our website.

Enjoy!
