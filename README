Hi there.  This is the README file for yt, which is a set of Enzo management
tools.

yt is broken into several categories.  Note that in the descriptions, I will
speak about them in the present tense, and yet, at the time of writing
(08FEB07) all of these are mere skeletons.

    yt          -- This base module is always imported, and includes the
                   global configuration for the yt modules.
    enki        -- Here we initiate new runs; enki creates parameter files,
                   manages initial conditions, and handles enzo source code.
    fido        -- Data movement and automated plotting taes place here.  All
                   file handling takes place through fido.
    lagos       -- This is the heart of our Enzo handling.  All Enzo data
                   structures are kept and defined here.  All data handling
                   takes place through lagos.
    raven       -- This is the interface to HippoDraw, where all the slicing
                   takes place.
    deliverator -- These classes and routines deal with interaction with The
                   Deliverator.  (Eventually the deliverator ittself will be
                   checked into CVS.)

Anyway, please, feel free to help out.  Some somewhatÂ­outdated outlines can be
found in doc/ and I've sketched out some of the interfaces.
