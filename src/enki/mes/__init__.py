Mythological Origin and Nature of "Mes"
=======================================

The mes were originally collected by Enlil and then handed over to the
guardianship of Enki who was to broker them out to the various Sumerian
centers beginning with his own city of Eridu and continuing with Ur, Meluhha
and Dilmun. This is described in the poem, "Enki and the World Order" which
also details how he parcels out responsibility for various crafts and natural
phenomena to the lesser gods. Here the mes of various places are extolled but
are not themselves clearly specified, and they seem to be distinct from the
individual responsibilities of each divinity as they are mentioned separately
and proper to places, not gods. After a considerable amount of
self-glorification on the part of Enki, his daughter Inanna comes before him
with a complaint that she has been given short shrift on her divine spheres
of influence. Enki does his best to placate her by pointing up those she does
in fact possess.

There is no direct connection implied in the mythological cycle between this
poem and that which is our main source of information on the mes, "Inanna and
Enki: The Transfer of the Arts of Civilization from Eridu to Erech", but once
again Inanna's discontent is a theme. She is the tutelary deity of Erech and
desires to increase its influence and glory by bringing the mes to it from
Eridu. She travels to Enki's Eridu shrine, the E-abzu, in her "boat of
heaven", and asks the mes from him after he is well into his cups, whereupon
he complies. After she departs with them he comes to his senses and notices
they are missing from their usual place, and on being informed what he did
with them attempts to retrieve them. The attempt fails, and Inanna
triumphantly delivers them to Erech.

We never learn what any of the mes look like, yet they are represented as
physical objects of some sort. Not only are they stored in a prominent
location in the E-abzu, but Inanna is able to display them to the people of
Erech after she arrives with them in her boat. Some of them are indeed
physical objects such as musical instruments, but many are technologies like
"basket weaving" or abstractions like "victory". It is not made clear in the
poem how such things can be stored, handled, or displayed.

Not all the mes are admirable or desirable traits. Alongside functions like
"heroship" and "victory" we also find "the destruction of cities",
"falsehood", and "enmity". It seems that the Sumerians considered such evils
and sins an inevitable part of humanity's lot in life, divinely and
inscrutably decreed, and not to be questioned.
