We also include the Delaunay Triangulation module written by Robert Kern of
Enthought, the cmdln.py module by Trent Mick, and the progressbar module by
Nilton Volpato.  The PasteBin interface code (as well as the PasteBin itself)
was written by the Pocoo collective (pocoo.org).

Thanks to everyone for all your contributions!
